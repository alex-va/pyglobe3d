# PyGlobe3D
PyGlobe3D is a free open-source logical-graphical Python library for creating globes by hexagon-like polygons and working with them.

A surface consists mainly of hexagon-like polygons consisting of six triangles and also twelve additional pentagon-like polygons consisting of five triangles and lying only in the vertices of the icosahedron. They approximate the sphere or any part of the sphere.

Changing the radius of the sphere for any surface unit can create arbitrary 3D surfaces on the sphere. The logical component is that each surface unit knows its nearest neighbor units that is implemented algorithmically, not by storage. Due to that, discrete movement on the surface can be realized.
