# pyglobe3d
PyGlobe3D is a free open-source logical-graphical Python library for creating globes by discrete-surface units like hexagons and working with them. 

The discrete-surface units are mainly "hexagons" and also 12 additional "pentagons" lying in the vertices of the icosahedron. They build a sphere or an arbitrary part of sphere. Changing the radius of the sphere for any unit of surface can create arbitrary 3D surfaces on the sphere. The logical component is that each surface unit knows its nearest neighbors-units.
